Welcome to Rawdlite's Audio documentation!
==========================================

**This is a place where i document my journey in the Land of digital Audio**

Emphasis is on issues around network streamers based on Raspberry 4 and other SBCs like the asus Tinkerboard and the Odroid C2.
There are an abundance of ready made solutions one can install via a complette image. Yet sooner or later i find something i want to tinker with and this approach feels to limiting for my taste.

If you enjoy the indepedence of `free software <https://www.fsf.org/>`_, like to know how thinks work and to optimize your listening experience, then this documentation might be for you.
